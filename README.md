The Human-Robot Interaction API is a high level, domain specific API designed to make it easy to create human-robot interaction applications. It contains high level interfaces for: controlling robot actions, subscribing to social communication and representing and querying perception data.

The API provides high level classes to represent the robot being programmed, for example the Nao robot is represented by the Nao class. Each robot class contains functions to make the robot: speak, gaze at objects, show expressions and perform gestures. As well as performing actions, robots can subscribe to communication callbacks. In this version of the API, the Robot class has a communication callback to enable the programmer to subscribe to speech the robot has recognised. In future API versions there will also be callbacks that subscribe to the facial expressions and gestures people make. 

and the entities the robot interacts with
